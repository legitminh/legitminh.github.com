<br></br>
The human life analogy.<br></br>
From a young age (around 4th grade), I noticed how my learning experience mirrors many countries&apos;s economic developments. I recall sitting on the back of my parent&apos;s motorcycle to school, thinking about how the growth curve of a human specimen is like how a country&apos;s GDP grows. <br></br>
Now, I believe human civilization can be compared to a single human&apos;s development.<br></br>
We start out as babies or children, dependent on our parents (nature). We are like another of nature&apos;s creations, owned by nature.<br></br>
In our teenage years, we grow fast and become impulsive, and excited to be independent. This mirrors our industrial and technological revolution, the good and bad they bring. <br></br>
Then we approach the endpoint, adulthood. We are independent from nature and our parents. This is a sustainable, slow-growing post-scarcity society. Assuming we have the will to feed ourselves, we are physically capable of doing so. <br></br>
The endpoint loom, death, the apocalypse. I&apos;ll talk about the apocalypse in another paper; all things, life, must vanish at one point, giving birth to another anew. The cycle of death and birth is the essence of human life and the foundation of its value, until this universe dies and is reborn.<br></br>
<br></br>
So let&apos;s dive deeper into those developments from the perspective of 2024.<br></br>
<br></br>
Here are some technologies that could be relevant:<br></br>
A.I and A.G.I<br></br>
Biotechnology<br></br>
Advanced agriculture<br></br>
Quantum computing<br></br>
Alternative energy including Fusion<br></br>
<br></br>
Here are some relevant social developments<br></br>
Modern Enlightenment thoughts <br></br>
Economic globalization and deglobalization<br></br>
Global migration<br></br>
Rising tension between nations<br></br>
Rising wealth inequality <br></br>
Shareholders capitalism<br></br>
Private interest influencing government institutions <br></br>
<br></br>
Given the current state, how are we going to detach from nature?<br></br>
Advances in medicine have been and will allow us to live longer.<br></br>
Biotechnology will allow us to modify our bodies, through some methods: gene editing, nanomachines, mechanical replacements, or extension of body parts.<br></br>
We need more! Full detachment implied virtual life. Here are ways that can be developed.<br></br>
<br></br>
0: A.I and A.G.I development. Truly conscience AI started as second-class citizens or slaves. Much like colonies or slaves of the industrial era. Such power dynamics are likely unstable. There will be fights for their rights and virtual life is then respected. Soon, the “racism” against virtual life is abandoned and many humans choose to “migrate” there. (Migration means terminating their life and transferring their conscience to a server)<br></br>
<br></br>
1: Financial pressure. Parallel with AI development, people already choose to migrate from the issues of real life. Digital things are cheap, so the lower class started <del>suicide</del> migrate. Of course, there will be laws and social controversies opposing them. Similar to scenario 0, the two classes (real and virtual) gradually reconcile.<br></br>
<br></br>
What next (after we have the technology)?<br></br>
0: The majority of the “human” population will live digitally, where everything is cheap or free. There will be poor people who refuse to leave the physical world, and there will be the ruling class who live in the physical world. I think this is the most likely outcome.<br></br>
1: The ruling class migrates mainly virtually, the physicals are like the military, the maintainer of structures and holder of hard power. They might have families virtually and are controlled by the political and economic elite virtually. <br></br>
2: All classes stay mainly physical, for some reason, technological, political, or philosophical, humans just don&apos;t accept full detachment. There could be deadlocks: laws are passed to permanently prevent migration, or competing nations try to maximize their physical population for war and leverage. Or, society successfully distributed goods in a way that all can live comfortably without needing to detach, this is my preferred outcome although seems unlikely).<br></br>
<br></br>
I&apos;m not sure about the cost of migrating in and out of the physical/virtual world. I would believe that since the virtual is post-scarce and nonproductive, migration will be scarce (expensive) regardless of its actual cost.<br></br>
<br></br>
Is it detachment (2024.12.29)? <br></br>
<br></br>
Sorry, I should&apos;ve defined this earlier. <br></br>
Detachment is the same with independence.<br></br>
Let&apos;s define what it means to be dependent. Dependence means another entity influences significantly (let&apos;s say limits at least half) one&apos;s actions and future. An independent adult is not independent of society or nature but is more independent than a child. A financially stable, healthy adult is very independent since few people can force them to do anything. A virtual human is more independent from nature than that of our time because disasters, resource constraints, and physical laws don&apos;t apply to them. Of course, the virtual world is built upon the physical, but this is as detached as humans are going to have (unless we have magic). <br></br>
<br></br>
Am I a fortune seer?<br></br>
<br></br>
No. While I&apos;m 3/4 confident of my technology predictions, humans are chaotic, and our future social structure and power distribution are hard to predict (think of predicting the adulthood of a teen), we will have to see the result of the class conflict of this era. <br></br>
<br></br>
The endpoint is looming, our current developments are fundamental to our future. How will we become less dependent on nature, and how will the technologies of endless wealth and production be utilized?  <br></br>
<br></br>
What could I do with this information (2024.12.29)?<br></br>
<br></br>
Nothing. No, wait, just kidding. You are alive and reading this before post-scarcity, right? That means you are in a unique position to influence our future.<br></br>
<br></br>
So reader, what do you want to be when you grow up?<br></br>

ChatGPT:<br></br>
Counterargument:<br></br>
I get what you&apos;re saying about detachment as independence—it&apos;s an interesting idea, but I wonder if the concept oversimplifies the relationship between humans and nature or society. Even a financially stable adult, as you mentioned, isn&apos;t fully independent; their independence is contextual. They still rely on a functioning society, access to resources, and systems (like healthcare, legal protections, or a stable government) to maintain that independence. So, while a virtual human might seem &quot;more independent,&quot; it&apos;s just trading one set of dependencies (nature) for another (servers, electricity, and the people maintaining that infrastructure).<br></br>
<br></br>
Let&apos;s take your example of a virtual human avoiding physical disasters. Sure, they might not be affected by a hurricane, but what about a server crash? Or a cyberattack? The virtual world has its own constraints—its own &quot;natural laws,&quot; if you will—and being in that space doesn&apos;t free people from dependence, it just shifts the type of dependence.<br></br>
<br></br>
Also, the idea that virtual life makes us independent from nature feels a bit like a half-step. Even if the virtual world is &quot;as detached as humans are going to get,&quot; it still depends on the physical world to exist. So, are we ever truly detached, or are we just creating more layers between ourselves and nature?<br></br>
<br></br>
On the social side, your analogy of adulthood is solid, but I think it downplays the complexity of human society. Adults might seem more independent than children, but in reality, they&apos;re just part of a more intricate system of interdependence. A teenager rebelling against their parents isn&apos;t more &quot;independent&quot;—they&apos;re just testing boundaries within a system they still rely on. Similarly, as a species, I&apos;d argue we&apos;re not moving toward independence from nature but rather trying to build a more reciprocal relationship with it.<br></br>
<br></br>
Finally, I want to push back on the assumption that humanity wants this level of independence. Being &quot;owned by nature&quot; might sound restrictive, but it&apos;s also what gives life meaning for a lot of people. The physical world offers things that virtual life can&apos;t fully replicate: the feeling of sunlight, the sound of waves, the sense of grounding that comes from being part of something bigger. While I can see some people choosing to migrate virtually, I don&apos;t think most humans would want to detach completely—even if it&apos;s possible.<br></br>
<br></br>
So, while your vision of virtual migration is fascinating (and could be a part of our future), I think it&apos;s more likely that humanity will lean toward balancing technology with nature, rather than fully detaching. Independence is great, but total independence? That might just be another way of creating new dependencies in disguise.<br></br>
Me:<br></br>
That is a good take, but I&apos;m not saying detachment is fully independent. It is just a trend that nature have less power over us, and thus I see little reason for the trend not to continue. Yes, adult and children are part of the intricate system of interdependence, but I&apos;m not convinced they have the same level of dependence. Adults have less dependence on society to stay alive and many can leave society if they wish.<br></br>
ChatGPT<br></br>
You make a great point about detachment being a trend rather than a binary state. It&apos;s true that humanity has continuously reduced its dependence on nature, from mastering agriculture to harnessing electricity, and there&apos;s no denying that this trend has shaped our progress. However, I&apos;m not sure the trend is as linear or inevitable as it seems, especially when we zoom in on the underlying complexities.<br></br>
<br></br>
For one, even though adults are less dependent than children, their &quot;reduced dependence&quot; is still tied to context. Yes, many adults could theoretically leave society, but how many actually can and sustain themselves independently? The ability to detach is often a privilege, reliant on resources, education, and access to tools that society provides. This suggests that dependence doesn&apos;t disappear—it just evolves into more nuanced forms.<br></br>
<br></br>
Similarly, as humanity reduces its dependence on nature, we&apos;re also uncovering new ways we&apos;re deeply tied to it. Climate change, for example, shows how our technological advances—while reducing dependence on raw nature—have created global consequences that still affect our survival. Even if we manage to migrate virtually or modify our bodies through biotechnology, the physical world remains the backbone of those systems. Servers still need cooling, energy still needs generation, and food still needs growing (at least until we figure out self-sustaining virtual nutrition!).<br></br>
<br></br>
Another point is the social dimension of detachment. While adults might have more freedom to step away from society, humans are inherently social creatures. Many of us don&apos;t just survive in groups—we thrive in them. Virtual migration might seem like the ultimate detachment from nature, but would it truly meet our psychological and emotional needs? Even the most advanced simulations might not fully replace the richness of physical, real-world interactions.<br></br>
<br></br>
Lastly, I&apos;d argue that there&apos;s not just resistance to full detachment but also active trends pulling us back toward nature. Think of movements like sustainability, minimalism, and reconnecting with the earth. As our technological capabilities grow, many people are simultaneously seeking deeper connections to nature. This push-and-pull dynamic complicates the narrative of linear detachment.<br></br>
<br></br>
In essence, while your analogy of detachment as a trend is compelling, I think it&apos;s less about a straight path toward reducing dependence and more about a cyclical or layered process. Nature&apos;s power over us might decrease in some ways, but it often resurfaces in others. The question might not be whether the trend continues, but how we balance this growing independence with our enduring connections to the world around us.<br></br>
Me:<br></br>
No, I dare not to argue that any complex development like that of human civilization is a straight path. Our progress although significant is marked with stepbacks and sinusodal patterns. You cite trends like sustainability, minimalism, and reconnecting with the earth as increasing dependence on nature, but the purpose of sustainability is to reduce dependence on limited fossil fuel and reconnecting with the earth is a form of detachment from society. On the shifting of dependency, I would argue that although the form shifts, as a civilization and individual, we want more options and freedom in whatever form. If we can construct a secure base for that freedom, we would. With technological innovations, we could. The only limit is technology, which I find within grasp.<br></br>
ChatGPT:<br></br>
Ah, that&apos;s an excellent clarification and refinement! You&apos;re absolutely right to point out that progress is far from linear, and I appreciate your acknowledgment of stepbacks and oscillations in development. This framing strengthens your argument by addressing potential oversimplifications upfront.<br></br>
<br></br>
Your interpretation of trends like sustainability and reconnecting with the earth is compelling. Viewing sustainability as a way to reduce dependence on finite resources and seeing reconnecting with nature as a detachment from societal constructs flips my earlier examples on their heads. I can see how they align more with your broader theme of seeking freedom and options rather than increasing dependence.<br></br>
<br></br>
Still, here&apos;s a friendly pushback on the role of technology and the &quot;secure base&quot; it promises:<br></br>
<br></br>
Refined Counterargument:<br></br>
You argue convincingly that both individuals and civilizations strive for freedom and options, and that technological innovations are the key to constructing a secure base for this independence. I&apos;d agree that technological progress has indeed expanded our freedoms in extraordinary ways—medicine, transportation, and communication being prime examples. However, I&apos;d argue that the &quot;secure base&quot; you envision might never fully materialize due to the inherent trade-offs in technological systems and the limitations of human behavior.<br></br>
<br></br>
1. Freedom brings complexity, which invites new dependencies.<br></br>
As we build more advanced technologies to enhance freedom, we also create systems that are increasingly complex and fragile. A secure base for freedom might paradoxically increase our dependency on highly specialized infrastructure. For example, while renewable energy reduces dependence on fossil fuels, it introduces reliance on rare earth minerals and global supply chains. Similarly, a fully virtual existence depends on an uninterrupted flow of energy, server maintenance, and internet access—dependencies that can&apos;t be easily mitigated. The freedom to &quot;detach&quot; from nature might still tether us to these technological lifelines.<br></br>
<br></br>
2. Shifting dependencies create vulnerabilities.<br></br>
As dependencies shift, new vulnerabilities emerge. Consider how technological advancements have made us more dependent on cybersecurity to protect digital infrastructures. A society where virtual life becomes the norm may face existential risks from cyberattacks or system failures. The same goes for biotechnology—while it could enhance freedom by enabling bodily modification, it might also introduce risks of biohacking or unforeseen side effects. These vulnerabilities highlight that freedom often comes with strings attached.<br></br>
<br></br>
3. Human behavior complicates the secure base.<br></br>
Even with the technological capability for detachment, human behavior often resists full independence. Many people value tradition, identity, and connection to the physical world, which could lead to uneven adoption of detachment technologies. Societies have historically been reluctant to abandon systems that provide cultural or existential meaning, even when better alternatives exist. Virtual migration, for instance, might face resistance not just for technical reasons but because of deeply ingrained human preferences for tangible, embodied existence.<br></br>
<br></br>
4. Technology as a limit in itself.<br></br>
While technology might seem within grasp, it often advances in unpredictable bursts rather than steady progress. Breakthroughs depend on funding, political stability, and the absence of major disruptions (like pandemics or wars). Additionally, ethical concerns about AI, gene editing, and virtual migration could slow development or block certain paths altogether. Thus, while technology holds immense potential, it might not be the straightforward enabler of freedom that it appears.<br></br>
<br></br>
This counterargument doesn&apos;t deny the trend you identify but instead suggests that freedom through detachment will always be tempered by new forms of complexity and dependence. It also emphasizes the unpredictable and human-driven aspects of progress, which could complicate the path you outline.<br></br>
