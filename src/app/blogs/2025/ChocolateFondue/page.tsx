    The Chef&apos;s citizens awake one by one. Below them lies a haphazard floor scattered with magnetic metal fragments, mostly thin and light, if not tugged down by the floor. Then down pours the rain. Constant laminar streams of chocolate spread from the center of the sky. Columns of viscous brown liquid join Heaven and Earth. The citizens rejoiced and opened their mouths to welcome the sweet. They dance and sing as the ground becomes animated with rivers of chocolate. Heaven came to Earth that day and stayed.<br/><br/>
    But amidst the celebration was a man isolated from the rain. He investigates the magnetic characteristics of the plates, and he plays with them, building abstract sculptures. He first builds a cubical bowl to store some fondue for quick energy recharge as he continues his work. Some citizens laugh at him, thinking he was mad. But the Pioneer ignores the noise.<br/><br/>
    The fondue flow is slightly inconsistent&mdash;but always sufficient. Above the metal food ricer used to control the flow of chocolate is an algorithmic system. The Chef would place chocolate blocks on an inclined pan with an opening in its wall. The pan is heated by a mounted flame. The chocolate would melt and pour down on the ricer, building up a reservoir. When the reservoir is low, more chocolate is supplied.<br/><br/>
    As time registers, citizens become complacent with the abundance and simple life. The Pioneer then erects his massive structure, casting a shadow on countless citizens. &quot;Citizens, meet Funnel.&quot; The man walks toward the center of the plate with his towering &quot;second sky&quot;. His head bends dignified toward the sky. His mouth opens wide as fondue pours in. Citizens are confused and afraid. The great columns joining Heaven and earth shatter.<br/><br/>
    Many run towards the perimeter of the plate. They build a dam of flesh, competing for gaps in the sky. The pleasant population became restless, shouting and screaming. The Pioneer, too, understands the weight of his actions. The gushing chocolate overwhelms his maximally widened mouth, dressing him in an incriminating brown. He shouted, &quot;If you want chocolate, lift me up and you may enjoy my charity.&quot; Although most are angry contemplating how to deal with the Pioneer, a few realize their distance from the remaining stretches of visible sky. And so they lifted the man up. In a forced parentship, the Followers drink from the Pioneer&apos;s mouth, cloth, and feet. The Followers compete for position around the Pioneer to best enjoy the chocolate that had escaped the consumption of others.<br/><br/>
    Soon the Conic Mountain grew, the Pioneer became larger, his mouth became wider, and he was supported by more and more citizens. The Pioneer&apos;s hands bleed as the Funnel&apos;s neck cuts his skin. But turning back ceased to be an option. And soon the masses became more desperate. They fling magnetic pieces at the Cone. Most fly in chaotic trajectories, some even slit the perpetrator&apos;s own throat. The Followers comprising the Cone would fight back, some cycling in and out defending their sacred hill. Others are trampled by the Cone as the Cone starts to move in chaotic patterns. As the Funnel swings, some sections of the plate&apos;s perimeter are blocked by the Funnel and sometimes flooded with fondue. With the dynamic landscape, the citizens drift.<br/><br/>
    After some time of restlessness, some Criminals in the starving masses engineer weapons to launch sharp metallic plates. They shoot at the Funnel and puncture the sky. Fondue escapes on the spot and triggers a mini cone of citizens trying to appreciate the Criminal&apos;s work. But debris may also cause collateral damage as it lands on some unfortunate soul. The Funnel wobbles as fondue flows unevenly down its neck. Amidst the cacophony, the Criminal convene to vote on shooting the Pioneer. Then, they shove the starving masses to make a clearing for their last shot. The metal plate flies madly like a crashing plane into the Cone. To everyone&apos;s terror, the Pioneer almost loses the Funnel&apos;s balance. For a split second, the inflated and greedy Pioneer smiled at his own greatness and skill in preventing the Funnel from crashing down on countless. Some Followers pass up metal plates to shield their holy Cone and supreme Pioneer. Other Followers run wildly towards the Criminals for revenge. A bloody fight initiates as the starving Criminals and other citizens defend their launch machine. Begins the relentless struggle of the population against the Silver Cone overlord.<br/><br/>
    The Chef returns. The Chef had a quick chat with some other Chefs about cooking stuff. As the last block of chocolate begins to melt, and the Chef realizes the ill-behaved citizens, the Chef cuts off the flow through the ricer.<br/><br/>
    It takes a moment for the population to feel the effect of the cut. The information spreads from reporters who see the ricer at the perimeter flesh wall. When the Pioneer saw the ricer due to the diminished flow from the Funnel, he was overtaken with disbelief. Quickly the Followers realise they are now defending a fraud. Their priestly Pioneer can no longer offer them Heaven&apos;s blessing. Outcry. The flesh Cone buckles. The heavy Pioneer tried in vain to support his metallic sky. But he crashed down on his Followers. He rolled and crushed the poor citizens who stood in his way. The Funnel had some sort of buoyancy due to its great radius. The Funnel&apos;s neck floated to and fro like Heaven&apos;s Excalibur&mdash;God&apos;s finger choosing an ant to crush. Then it crashed down at an angle and the Cone shattered. A large stretch of it pressed the ground flat radially from the Pioneer to the edge of the plate. Other fragments flew about, some cut down the screaming citizens like pins, and others would slice them like how a Chef would prepare a sashimi. From the debris, survivors rise one by one, to a Heaven thoroughly detached from Earth.
